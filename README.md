# diffModesF2F
diffModeF2F calculates the diffusion coefficient of a track from its frame-to-frame displacements, taking into account the trackâ€™s localization precision. If distinct diffusion modes have been previously defined, the software also classifies each track into one of the specified diffusion modes based on its calculated diffusion coefficient.
